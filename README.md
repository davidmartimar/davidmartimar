# Hi, I'm David 👋 I build AI systems that solve business problems.


```python
class DavidMartinez():
    
  def __init__(self):
    self.name = "David Martinez Martin";
    self.username = "davidmartimar";
    self.location = "Barcelona, Spain";
    self.linkedin = "@davidmartimar";
  
  def __str__(self):
    return self.name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    me = DavidMartinez()
```

I specialize in bridging the gap between raw AI capabilities and real-world business efficiency. I don't just write scripts; I build robust **Autonomous Agents**, **RAG Systems**, and **Automations** that save hundreds of operational hours.

### 👨‍💻 Why Me?

* **Hybrid Profile:** I combine the technical rigor of an Engineer with the creative problem-solving of a Designer. I don't type code; I build products.
* **Focus on ROI:** I don't use AI because it's "cool". I use it to automate boring tasks so humans can do the important work.
* **Continuous Builder:** Always learning the latest in Agentic Workflows (LangGraph, AutoGen) and Local LLMs.
